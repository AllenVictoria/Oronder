Oronder provides deep Discord integration for Foundry Virtual Tabletop. Access your character sheets, roll for
downtime activities, schedule sessions and reward exp all without needing to log back into Foundry.

Oronder is designed to meet the needs of running a complex Westmarches game with multiple DMs and players,
but also shines for single party campaigns.

### Installation Instructions

_The following must be done by the owner of the Discord server you'd like to integrate with._

1. From Foundry, select **Game Settings > Configure Settings > Oronder > Configure Oronder**.
    - Click the button to invite Oronder's Bot to your Discord Server.
      - A popup will ask you to select the server and verify permissions.
    - Associate Foundry Names to Discord Names and Configure Channels.
    - Click `Save Changes`.
2. Subscribe to the [Oronder Discord](https://discord.gg/27npDAXaCA) to gain access to advanced features.

Players should now be able to access characters they own in Foundry from Discord.
If a PC is not showing up, ensure that player ownership has been assigned and that the character has a class, race and
background.
